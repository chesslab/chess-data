# Data Mining

Data mining provides an additional boost to the SQL queries that can be performed on the `games` table. The precondition for data mining is to seed the `games` table with data.

The CLI commands described below are to populate the columns suffixed with the word `_mine` with pre-calculated data for further analysis. The algorithm used to mine the data may be more or less time-consuming.

| Time | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| ðŸ’Ž | The data mining command is not time-consuming. |
| ðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž | The data mining command is not too time-consuming.  |
| ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž | The data mining command is time-consuming. |

Please note the difference with the seed commands, which are meant for loading the tables with data.

## CLI Commands

### ðŸ’Ž `fen.php`

The example below populates the `fen_mine` column with chess positions in FEN format on a player basis:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/fen.php "Anand,V"
```

This column is intended to store a text string of comma-separated values representing the chess positions in a game. It allows to search games by piece placement in FEN format.

#### Example

Fetch all games matching a particular position.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  games
WHERE
  fen_mine LIKE '%r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R%';
```

### ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž `heuristics.php`

The example below calculates the `heuristics_mine` column on a player basis:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/heuristics.php "Anand,V"
```

This command requires the `fen_mine` column to be populated with data.

The `heuristics_mine` column is intended to store a JSON object representing the [PHP Chess heuristics](https://chesslablab.github.io/php-chess/heuristics/) in a game. It allows to gather insights about the decisions that have been made to make the moves. With this data, you can take advantage of [MySQL JSON functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-functions.html) to perform operations on JSON values like in the following examples.

#### Example

Fetch the material evaluation in all games won by Anand with the white pieces.

```sql
SELECT
  JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[*][0]') as material
FROM
  games
WHERE
  heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL
  AND White = "Anand,V"
  AND Result = '1-0';
```

The index in the second parameter of the `JSON_EXTRACT` function `$[*][0]` corresponds to the index of the PHP Chess function being used in the [cli/mine/heuristics.php](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-data/blob/main/cli/mine/heuristics.php) script.

See:

- [Chess\Function\FastFunction](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/main/src/Function/FastFunction.php)

Thus, `[0]` corresponds to the material evaluation in the fast function array.

#### Example

Convert the material evaluation array of a random game won by Anand with the white pieces from JSON to MySQL.

```sql
SET
  @j = (
    SELECT
      JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[*][0]') as material
    FROM
      games
    WHERE
      heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL
      AND White = "Anand,V"
      AND Result = '1-0'
    ORDER BY
      RAND()
    LIMIT
      1
);
```

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  JSON_TABLE(
    @j,
    "$[*]" COLUMNS(
      id FOR ORDINALITY,
      value FLOAT PATH "$"
    )
  ) time;
```
