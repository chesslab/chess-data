The precondition for data mining is to seed the games table with data. The following commands are to populate the columns suffixed with the word _mine with pre-calculated data for further analysis. With the mine commands, an algorithm is required to process the data in the games table. Please note the difference with the seed commands, which are meant for loading the tables with data. The algorithm used to mine data may be more or less time-consuming as per the number of diamonds below. Diamonds Description \ud83d\udc8e A little time-consuming \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e Not too time-consuming \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e Time-consuming \ud83d\udc8e fen_mine This column is intended to store a text string of comma-separated values representing the chess positions in a game. It allows to search games by piece placement in FEN format. The example below populates the fen_mine column with chess positions in FEN format on a player basis: docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/fen.php \"Anand,V\" \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e heuristics_mine This column is intended to store a JSON object representing the heuristics in a game. It allows to gather insights about the decisions that have been made to make the moves. The example below populates the heuristics_mine column with heuristics data on a player basis: docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/heuristics.php \"Anand,V\" With the data from the heuristics mine, you can take advantage of MySQL JSON functions to perform operations on JSON values like in the following examples. Example 1 Fetch the material evaluation in all games won by Anand with the white pieces. SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0]') FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND White = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '1-0'; The index in the second parameter of the JSON_EXTRACT function $[0] corresponds to the index of the PHP Chess function being used in the cli/mine/heuristics.php script. See: Chess\\Function\\FastFunction Thus, $[0] corresponds to the material evaluation in the fast function array. Example 2 Fetch the material evaluation for the tenth move (20 plies) in all games won by Anand with the black pieces. SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0][19]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND Black = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '0-1'; Example 3 Fetch the games won by Anand with the black pieces having a material disadvantage of at least 0.1 in the tenth move. SELECT movetext, JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0][19]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND Black = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '0-1' GROUP BY Material, movetext HAVING Material >= 0.1; Example 4 Convert a material evaluation array from JSON to MySQL for further processing. SET @j = ( SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1 ); SELECT * FROM JSON_TABLE( @j, \"$[*]\" COLUMNS(balance FLOAT PATH \"$\") ) material; Example 5 Sum all elements in the previous material evaluation array.
