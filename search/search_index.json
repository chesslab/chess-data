The precondition for data mining is to seed the games table with data. An algorithm is required to process the data in the games table. The CLI commands described below are to populate the columns suffixed with the word _mine with pre-calculated data for further analysis. The algorithm used to mine data may be more or less time-consuming.

It allows to search games by piece placement in FEN format. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e heuristics.php The example below populates the heuristics_mine column with heuristics data on a player basis: docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/heuristics.php \"Anand,V\" This column is intended to store a JSON object representing the heuristics in a game. It allows to gather insights about the decisions that have been made to make the moves. With the data from the heuristics mine, you can take advantage of MySQL JSON functions to perform operations on JSON values like in the following examples. Example Fetch the material evaluation in all games won by Anand with the white pieces. SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0]') FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND White = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '1-0'; The index in the second parameter of the JSON_EXTRACT function $[0] corresponds to the index of the PHP Chess function being used in the cli/mine/heuristics.php script. See: Chess\\Function\\FastFunction Thus, $[0] corresponds to the material evaluation in the fast function array. Example Fetch the material evaluation for the tenth move (20 plies) in all games won by Anand with the black pieces. SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0][19]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND Black = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '0-1'; Example Fetch the games won by Anand with the black pieces having a material disadvantage of at least 0.1 in the tenth move. SELECT movetext, JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[0][19]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND Black = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '0-1' GROUP BY Material, movetext HAVING Material >= 0.1; Example Convert a material evaluation array from JSON to MySQL for further processing.
