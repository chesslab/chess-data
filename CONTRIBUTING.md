But hang on a minute, it's not always peaches and cream, especially at the beginning of your career path to becoming a full-stack developer.

If you're looking forward to working on a startupish product — or want to transfer your skills to a different stack — but it still feels a little over your head, you may want to work together with a mentor solving ChesslabLab issues on GitHub.
