# ChesslabLab
## Open Source Community

The game of chess involves quite a few different aspects of software development, which makes it a perfect topic for learning full-stack web development as well as for playing around with machine learning libraries. A bunch of public chess repos ranging from React and JavaScript to PHP are available on the ChesslabLab community on GitHub.

### Contributing guidelines

- Find a ChesslabLab repo and make sure to read its `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- Look at the open issues.
- Leave the following comment on the issue you want to be assigned to: "Hi there, happy learning and coding!"
- Be prepared to create a friendly PR once the issue has been assigned to you.

Once you're ready, [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and create a new branch from `master` as per the following convention.

```text
$ git checkout -b issue/n-the-title-of-the-issue
```

For example, if the title of the issue is [Update to MUI 5 #236](https://github.com/chesslablab/redux-chess/issues/236) then its corresponding Git branch should be checked out from the main branch like this.

```text
$ git checkout -b issue/236-update-to-MUI-5
```

That's it! For further information please visit:

### But hang on a minute

It may not be as easy as it sounds, especially at the beginning of your career path to becoming a full-stack developer. So I thought that it'd be helpful to share some of my favorite episodes on creating a startupish product, from tesing and DevOps to data science, among others.
