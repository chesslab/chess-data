The precondition for data mining is to seed the games table with data. The CLI commands described below are to populate the columns suffixed with the word _mine with pre-calculated data for further analysis. The algorithm used to mine the data may be more or less time-consuming. Time Description \ud83d\udc8e The data mining command is not time-consuming. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e The data mining command is not too time-consuming. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e The data mining command is time-consuming. Please note the difference with the seed commands, which are meant for loading the tables with data. CLI Commands \ud83d\udc8e fen.php The example below populates the fen_mine column with chess positions in FEN format on a player basis: docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/fen.php \"Anand,V\" This column is intended to store a text string of comma-separated values representing the chess positions in a game. It allows to search games by piece placement in FEN format. Example Fetch all games matching a particular position. SELECT * FROM games WHERE fen_mine LIKE '%r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R%'; \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e heuristics.php The example below calculates the heuristics_mine column on a player basis: docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/mine/heuristics.php \"Anand,V\" This command requires the fen_mine column to be populated with data. The heuristics_mine column is intended to store a JSON object representing the PHP Chess heuristics in a game. It allows to gather insights about the decisions that have been made to make the moves. With this data, you can take advantage of MySQL JSON functions to perform operations on JSON values like in the following examples. Example Fetch the material evaluation in all games won by Anand with the white pieces. SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[*][0]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND White = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '1-0'; The index in the second parameter of the JSON_EXTRACT function $[*][0] corresponds to the index of the PHP Chess function being used in the cli/mine/heuristics.php script. See: Chess\\Function\\FastFunction Thus, [0] corresponds to the material evaluation in the fast function array. Example Convert the material evaluation array of a random game won by Anand with the white pieces from JSON to MySQL. SET @j = ( SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(heuristics_mine, '$[*][0]') as Material FROM games WHERE heuristics_mine IS NOT NULL AND White = \"Anand,V\" AND Result = '1-0' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1 ); SELECT * FROM JSON_TABLE( @j, \"$[*]\" COLUMNS( id FOR ORDINALITY, value FLOAT PATH \"$\" ) ) material; +------+-------+ | id | value | +------+-------+ | 1 | 0 | | 2 | 0 | | 3 | 0 | | 4 | 0 | | 5 | 0 | | 6 | 0 | | 7 | 0 | | 8 | 0 | | 9 | 0 | | 10 | 0 | | 11 | 0 | | 12 | 0 | | 13 | 0 | | 14 | 0 | | 15 | 0 | | 16 | 0 | | 17 | 0 | | 18 | 0 | | 19 | 0 | | 20 | 0 | | 21 | 0 | | 22 | -0.25 | | 23 | 0 | | 24 | 0 | | 25 | 0 | | 26 | 0 | | 27 | 0 | | 28 | 0 | | 29 | 0 | | 30 | 0 | | 31 | 0.55 | | 32 | 0 | | 33 | 0 | | 34 | -0.09 | | 35 | 0 | | 36 | 0 | | 37 | 0 | | 38 | -0.11 | | 39 | 0 | | 40 | 0 | | 41 | 0 | | 42 | 0 | | 43 | 0 | | 44 | -0.35 | | 45 | 0 | | 46 | 0 | | 47 | 0 | | 48 | 0 | | 49 | 0 | | 50 | 0 | | 51 | 0 | | 52 | 0 | | 53 | 0 | | 54 | 0 | | 55 | 0 | | 56 | 0 | | 57 | 0 | | 58 | 0 | | 59 | 0 | | 60 | 0 | | 61 | 0 | | 62 | 0 | | 63 | 0 | | 64 | 0 | | 65 | 0 | | 66 | 0 | | 67 | 0 | | 68 | -0.18 | | 69 | -0.41 | | 70 | -0.16 | | 71 | -0.1 | | 72 | -0.13 | | 73 | -0.28 | | 74 | -0.75 | | 75 | -0.18 | | 76 | -0.15 | | 77 | -0.08 | | 78 | -0.08 | | 79 | 0 | | 80 | 0 | | 81 | 0.57 | | 82 | 0 | | 83 | 0 | | 84 | 0 | | 85 | 0 | +------+-------+ 85 rows in set (0.00 sec) Example Sum all elements in the previous material evaluation array.
